I am going to commit how i created this project.
I first used npx create-react-app to create a react app name sracademy.After that i deleted some files that are not neccesary for my project from the project created, then i created a folder called components thats holds all my components and another one named assets that holds all my images.
I then created a component named Navbar with 2 files named Navbar.jsx and NavbarElements.jsx, NavbarElements.jsx holds all the stylings for the Navbar.
In the Navbar i created a main component Nav then styled it as Nav in the NavbarElements.jsx, After styling all the elements in the Navbar i then imported the component in App.js file.

I also created a Home components which holds all the elements and the stylings for the home section. I imported 4 different images in the home section and also imported the home component in the App.jsx

To get the about Section i also created a component named Home and it also hold all the stylings and the elements of the Home elements. After all the stylings i also imported the home component in the App.js

Same methods were used in creating the various sections of the web page.
I use styled-components to style all the elements of the whole web page.
